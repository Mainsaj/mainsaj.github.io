                        <p>My name is Alex Mains and I have spent most of my life in the figure skating community.</p>
                    <p>Before I can even remember my dad wanted me to follow in his foot steps and become a hockey player.
                        He put me into beginner hockey classes but was frustrated because I could not skate. My mom suggested
                        that I learn how to skate and learn hockey after and they enrolled me in ice skating classes.
                    </p>
                        <p>Ice skating was my fun winter activity and I slowly moved up the levels until I was about ten.
                            It was then that I told my mom I wanted to skate all year round. I began taking private lessons and the 
                            rest is history.
                        </p>

                        <p>I began skating competitively soon after and in 2012 I placed 4th at the Upper Great Lakes Regional Championships at the Intermediate level
                            and qualified for the Junior National Championships where I placed 21st.
                        </p>
                        <p>When I graduated high school I moved to Colorado Springs to begin training with the Olympic Training Center at the 
                            Colorado Springs World Arena. I trained there for just over a year before I decided to end my competitive career to attend college.
                        </p>
                        <p>However after a short time I decided that I missed the sport and wanted to reinvolve myself in some way. It was then that
                            I decided to become a coach that I might pass my knowledge onto the next generation of skaters.
